# AI-PROJECT-FOR-SEM-4
This program is as of now developed only for windows 10 
Linux/Unix version coming soon 
For <code>Quartz</code> has to be included (my friend won't let me test it on his Mac so you have to wait for a while)
<ol>
  <li>Install all the required python modules of the requirements.txt <br>
    <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> </li>
  <li>And don't worry dlib takes a lot of time to install depending on the performance of your system (On Windows)</li>

  <li>And dont forget to add you picture of choice (you pic) </li><br>
  
  <li>And add your image in the program directory</li>
  <li>go to <code>per_face_recognition.py</code> rename the image name from<code>sample1.jpg</code> to the name of the file you have saved in the directory
</ol>

## Caution
 ### Don't add your FBI Agents picture and blame me !!
<code>Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019</code> and <code>Visual C++ Build Tools</code> must be installed in prior installing the modules from the <b>requirements.txt</b> since dlib is dependent on <code>Visual C++ Build Tools</code>

## Warning 
#### I'm not responsible if you 2006 laptop melts running this code or stops working or your FBI agents breaks into your laptop 
#### Im not responsible for any damages caused using this program
#### And this is a very lame project for your final year engineering project so dont waste your time here
